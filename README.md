helped me stop frustrating after moving on mac after many years on windows.

## WINDOWS LIKE KEYBOARD (fn(ctrl for non apple keyboards) > left_command, ctrl+tab, ctrl+arrows behavior)
makes mac keyboard shortcuts in most programs work like on windows with normal keyboard
(fn+A = windows-like ctrl+A (actual cmd+A), ...)

## RDP, Virtual Machines (alt > win, cmd > alt, fn <> ctrl for apple keyboards)
in some Virtual Machine hosts I use make keyboard windows-like again

## RShift + Backspace = Delete (word with fn) for apple keyboards

## RShift + Enter = Insert

## RAlt + F7-F12 = media
for people with long fingers

## NUMPAD SIMUL: RAlt + k,./l;'op[ = keypad_0-9 [9]>[/] [0]>[*] ']'>[.]
